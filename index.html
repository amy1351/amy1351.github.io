				<p id = "introduction" style = "margin-top: 10px;">Hello! My name is Amy, and I'm a freshman at Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science.
				I grew up in Seattle and have lived there my whole life.
				While, I'm not learning as much as I can about technology, I enjoy reading, swimming, playing violin, running, and baking.
				<br>
				<br>
				Some fun facts about me:
				<!--
				<ul>
					<li>I once played in a concert with Macklemore and Ryan Lewis.</li>
					<li>I conquered the Via Ferrata in the mountains of West Virginia.</li>
					<li>Last summer, I helped put together a solar energy system to power a computer lab.</li>
				</ul>
			  -->

		<p id = "blurb">
		Last summer, I spent 3 1/2 weeks in the woods of West Virginia with no cell phone service and almost no internet connection.
		Surrounded by 106 fellow delegates from all 50 states and a few other countries, I learned about applications of STEM research in the real world and why it is important to have ethical leadership in these fields.
		I also gained a newfound appreciation for being in the great outdoors by going on three overnight backpacking trips and going rock climbing, caving, and mountain biking.
