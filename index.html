				<p id = "introduction" style = "margin-top: 10px;">Hello! I'm a rising senior at Carnegie Mellon University studying Computer Science with a minor in Neural Computation.
				On campus, I co-lead the undergraduate mentoring program for Women@SCS and SCS4ALL, and was previously a teaching assistant for 15-281 Artificial Intelligence: Representation and Problem-Solving.
				In my free time I enjoy rowing on my school's club team, playing violin, spending time with friends, reading, hiking, and baking.
				<br>
				<br>
				Some fun facts about me:
				<br>&bull; I once played in a concert with Macklemore and Ryan Lewis.
				<br>&bull; I have climbed the Via Ferrata in the mountains of West Virginia.
				<br>&bull; In 2018, I helped put together a solar energy system to power a computer lab.
